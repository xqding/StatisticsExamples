# Rao-Blackwellization Method

Rao-Blackwellization is a statistical method for constructing a better estimator, in the term of its mean square error, by transforming a crude estimator. The transformed estimator is often called a Rao-Blackwellized estimator; its mean square error is always smaller than or equal to that of the crude estimator, which is guaranteed by the Rao-Blackwell Theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rao–Blackwell_theorem). In this example, we compared the performance of Rao-Blackwellized estimatiors and that of naive estimators for both point estimation and density estimation problems for non-standard Student's t-distribution.
